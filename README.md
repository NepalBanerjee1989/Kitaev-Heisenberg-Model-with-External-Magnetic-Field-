# Kitaev-Heisenberg-Model-with-External-Magnetic-Field
We investigate the classical spin-liquid phase transitions on the honeycomb lattice using a Kitaev–Heisenberg framework.Starting from a frustrated Heisenberg model (J2 = J3 = J1/2), the system exhibits classical U(1) gauge spin-liquid behavior. Introducing pure bond-directional Kitaev interactions drives the system into a classical Z₂ spin-liquid phase. By interpolating between these Hamiltonians, 𝐻(𝑔)=(1−𝑔)𝐻(U1)+𝑔𝐻(Z2),we observe an intermediate regime with zigzag-AFM-like long-range order. Further inclusion of Γ interactions and strong in-plane magnetic fields (Hx = 4, Hy = 4, Hz = 0) leads to unconventional spin configurations beyond standard magnetic phases. Simulations are performed using classical Monte Carlo with a Metropolis single spin-flip algorithm. These results provide new insights into classical analogs of gauge spin liquids and the rich magnetic textures emerging from competing interactions.
